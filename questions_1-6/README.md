Questions 1 to 6
=========

Except question 6, every questions use jest for unit test. I've tried to ensure that every case are managed.

For question 6 juste copy content in src/question6/question6.js and paste it in your devtools console. The behaviour expected have been tested on :
- Safari 9 - Mac OS
- Firefox 53.0.3 - Mac OS
- Chrome 55 â€“ Windows

I did two versions of this questions one for current browser (using latest javascript syntax) and a another one for old browser


HOW TO START (Question 1 to 5)
=========
- yarn / npm install
- yarn / npm run test
- Watch in your terminal the results of unit tests
